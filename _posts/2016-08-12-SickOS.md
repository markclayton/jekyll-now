I know it's been entirely too long since my last post. Work, study, and family will definitely take up time. I had a break so I figured I'd do a little practice on [VulnHub](https://www.vulnhub.com/). I've been meaning to do the SickOS 1.1 VM so I'm glad I finally got around to it. Vulnhub has bene doing some absolutely amazing work, pushing out tons of VM's of varying content and difficulty. Shoutout to [@g0tmi1k](https://twitter.com/g0tmi1k) and the team for the amazing effort.
