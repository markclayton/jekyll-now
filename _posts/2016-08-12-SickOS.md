I know it's been entirely too long since my last post. Work, study, and family will definitely take up time. I had a break so I figured I'd do a little practice on [VulnHub](https://www.vulnhub.com/). I've been meaning to do the SickOS 1.1 VM so I'm glad I finally got around to it. Vulnhub has bene doing some absolutely amazing work, pushing out tons of VM's of varying content and difficulty. Shoutout to [@g0tmi1k](https://twitter.com/g0tmi1k) and the team for the amazing effort.
Lets get started. 

Of course, lets identify which IP our VM has been given. 

```bash
root@kali:~/Desktop/sickos# netdiscover -r 192.168.61.0/24

Next step...nmap. 

```bash

Okay, typically these VMs start off with a web app that contains a few vulnerabilities, however this time it's just SSH and a squid proxy. Given SSH is authenticated, squid proxy it is. After doing some research I figured out that you can use squid proxy to perform a pivot scan against localhost using this proxy to identify ports that were not initially accessible on the remote server. Idea comes from [here](https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/auxiliary/scanner/http/squid_pivot_scanning).  Hopefully now we will be able to identify a web server. 

First we need to configure Firefox to use the proxy. I'm sure most people are aware of this but [FoxyProxy](https://getfoxyproxy.org/) is an outstanding add-on for quickly adding/switching between proxies. After that's set up we visit localhost via the browser and voil√° we have a web app.

Examing the source doesn't give much, so lets do a directory brute force using dirb with the proxy option.
