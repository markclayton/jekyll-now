I know it's been entirely too long since my last post. Work, study, and family will definitely take up time. I had a break so I figured I'd do a little practice on [VulnHub](https://www.vulnhub.com/). I've been meaning to do the SickOS 1.1 VM so I'm glad I finally got around to it. Vulnhub has bene doing some absolutely amazing work, pushing out tons of VM's of varying content and difficulty. Shoutout to [@g0tmi1k](https://twitter.com/g0tmi1k) and the team for the amazing effort.
Lets get started. 

Of course, lets identify which IP our VM has been given. 

```bash

Okay, typically these VMs start off with a web app that contains a few vulnerabilities, however this time it's just SSH and a squid proxy. Given SSH is authenticated, squid proxy it is. After doing some research I figured out that you can use squid proxy to perform a pivot scan against localhost using this proxy to identify ports that were not initially accessible on the remote server. Idea comes from [here](https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/auxiliary/scanner/http/squid_pivot_scanning).  Hopefully now we will be able to identify a web server. 

First we need to configure Firefox to use the proxy. I'm sure most people are aware of this but [FoxyProxy](https://getfoxyproxy.org/) is an outstanding add-on for quickly adding/switching between proxies. After that's set up we visit localhost via the browser and voil√° we have a web app.

Examing the source doesn't give much, so lets do a directory brute force using dirb with the proxy option. 

```bash
root@kali:~/Desktop/sickos# dirb http://localhost -p 192.168.61.177:3128

Looking at robots.txt we see that the /wolfcms path is disallowed. Lets examine further. 

![wolfcms.png](/images/wolfcms.png)

Awesome we have more to work with. Given the nature of this engagement and a bit of a gut feeling, there is most likely a public exploit for this CMS. Sure enough, there [is](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/38000/) :) Basically its a arbitrary file upload vulnerability that allows you to upload any php file, no restrictions. 

To get to the vulnerable file upload page we need to get admin access, the site was still configured with the default creds of admin:admin so all is well. 

![wolfcms_admin.png](/images/wolfcms_admin.png)

Apart from the capability to upload a file, we can also craft our own PHP file inside of the application itself.

![https://cdn.meme.am/instances/500x/56158060.jpg](https://cdn.meme.am/instances/500x/56158060.jpg)

Just to switch things up I figured I'd use the b347k shell instead of the standard php webshells you find on the internet (although this one is from the internet as well)....stealth is not the name of the game here.

![wolfcms_backdoor_creation.png](/images/wolfcms_backdoor_creation.png)

Now we have our backdoor at /hello.php, giving us access as user www-data. While this is nice and all, I need a full shell to start escalating privileges. Lets set up nc to listen...

![nc_rs_catch.png](/images/nc_rs_catch.png)

and reverse shell out...

![b374_reverse_shell_php.png](/images/b374_reverse_shell_php.png)

While I'm performing my privilege escalation tricks (fantatic [guide](https://blog.g0tmi1k.com/2011/08/basic-linux-privilege-escalation/) by @g0tm1lk), I forgot that shells provided by nc suck cause you can't make a typo. So I need a better shell, hey I can be picky in this case :) Anyway, wolfcms has a mysql backend and investigating /var/www/wolfcms/config.php gives the credentials to the database. 

![config_php.png](/images/config_php.png)

Investigating /etc/passwd indicates the only "normal" user is 'sickos'. I'm willing to bet that the same credentials for mysql are the also for this user. Lets see if we can ssh in. 

```bash
root@kali:~/Desktop/sickos# ssh -l sickos 192.168.61.177

So what's cool here is the sickos user is a member of the sudoers group. It's one of the first things I try and it has worked on multiple engagements. This saves alot of time as you can drop into root as long as you known the current user's credentials. Let's grab the flag and we are out of here. 

```bash
sickos@SickOs:~$ sudo su -
[sudo] password for sickos: 
Sorry, try again.
[sudo] password for sickos:

ROOT!

You have Succesfully completed SickOS1.1.
Thanks for Trying

When I get some time I think I'll move onto SickOS 1.2. I'll be publish more posts soon, with content other than vulnhub walkthrougt!

Thanks for reading and happy hacking!
